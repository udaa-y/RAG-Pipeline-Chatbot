# RAG-Pipeline-Chatbot
The RAG Pipeline Chatbot is an n8n workflow that builds a retrieval-augmented FAQ assistant. It watches Google Drive for new files, processes them into embeddings with Google Gemini, stores them in Pinecone, and powers a chatbot agent with memory for accurate, context-aware answers.
